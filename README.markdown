How to blog
-----------

Lazy mode:
==========

Go into [the source/\_posts directory](https://github.com/sshchicago/website2014/tree/master/source/_posts)

Click the + next to "website2014 / source / \_posts / " that says "Create a new file here"

Name the file yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-post.markdown

Put the following block at the top of the file:

<pre>
---
layout: post
title: "Title of Post"
date: 2014-04-01 10:08
comments: true
categories: 
author: My Name
---
</pre>


Write your post below that, using [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). 


Images are a huge pain in the ass.

{% img center /images/photos/whatevs.png  %}

Then click "Commit new file", and bother somebody re: this new file you've committed.
