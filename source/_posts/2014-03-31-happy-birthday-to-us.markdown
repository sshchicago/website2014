How to throw a party in three easy steps.

1. Invite Friends & Family. Invite everyone!
2. Have Fun.
3. Repeat.

Ryan and I started off the day by making sure everything was as clean as it could be (Let's be honest now; It's a hackerspace so there is a certain level of messiness that is considered "the aesthetic"). We arranged the tables and decorated. A trip to Costco and quasi-effective signage were made by our valiant board and significant others while I furiously finished reviewing the FB Page, event page, and Indiegogo Campaign. We set up the food, music, and most importantly--tea!

And then...we chilled for maybe five minutes before the first hesitant party goers appeared! Every person who walked through the door has unlocked the "SSH:C HQ FOUND!" achievement. :D

And wow, what a turnout! People kept pouring in and we kept the tea hot. Brian, Matt, and I were delighted to discover that everybody enjoyed at least one cup throughout the duration of the evening. After a fun lock picking demonstration by our good friends TOOOL, and the mesmerizing power of our 3d Printer, it was time to cut the cake!

Celebrating your birthday is one thing, but toasting future success even better! We had the honour of launching our [Indiegogo campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/south-side-hackerspace-chicago) with our friends, family, and future hackers. The goal: $7000 dollars to help finish the space and buy the tools/safeguards we need to make ourselves 100% operational! Led by a fantastic drumroll, we hit the big FUND button and watched the donations roll in! In the first night alone (~3 hours since it was already 9:30), we raised over $100!

Thanks to everyone for sharing this very special day with us. It was awesome to meet so many new people and we wouldn't be here without those who have supported us from the very beginning. It was amazing to show off our progress.
Here's to a new and even more spectacular year of growth! ~And many more~
