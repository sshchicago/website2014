It's been a few weeks since the launch of our campaign and I have to admit, the hardest part is waiting! I thought it would be less stressful than designing the t-shirts and stickers (all those long nights changing font types and sizes at least 30 times, and then moving things a pixel to the left, two pixels to the right, and then a pixel to the left again, only to wake up next morning and find that it really ought to be a little to the right after all.)

Emailing friends and family, contacting local papers and university organizations, and watching the money trickle bit by bit in is much harder! Of course we appreciate every single donation, not only monetary, but from those who volunteered to give us their helping hands to construct the space once we get the supplies (thank you redditers!!).

We're just so excited to purchase the things we need and tons of people have invited us to participate in events. We're bursting with ideas for different public workshops/classes we'd like to hold, but we won't be able to until things are cleaned up and fully functional. *sigh*

Progress is progress though, and as of today we've hit $1,418 in donations. That's 20.26% funded! With over a month til the end, it seems like a long way off, but the goal is $7000!!! So yep, we're going to keep chugging!
