Cryptoparty is a worldwide movement organizing events to educate users
how to use cryptography. We've had two in quick succession at SSH with
great turnout and they've been a lot of fun! The motivation is to
empower regular people to protect their private data in an era of
widespread surveillance. There are many tools available to do this -
some more user friendly than others - and these events provide a forum
for technical folks to come together and help those who are interested
in learning how to keep themselves and their data safe.

The March Cryptoparty focused on setting up PGP for email encryption,
and the April one focused on using Tor for anonymous web browsing as
well as using Off-the-Record (OTR) messaging for encrypted instant
messaging using XMPP/Jabber. In April, we split things up
into two sessions: a session for absolute beginners where even the
word encryption is explained, and a session for those who have more
exposure to cryptography. For the inaugural advanced session, Eric
gave a nice talk on the mathematical assumptions behind public key
cryptography. Mason also showed us what data an attacker could gather
by exploiting the recent OpenSSL Heartbleed bug on a VM set up in the
space.

You can follow @Cryptopartychi on twitter to get notifications of
upcoming cryptoparties, as well as check out the Cryptoparty wiki page
at http://wiki.sshchicago.org/wiki/Cryptoparty. We plan on having
another Cryptoparty at SSH in July.

If you'd like to be involved in organizing Cryptoparty, that's great!
If you know how to use the most commonly taught tools - PGP/OTR/Tor -
and would like to help teach during the workshop time at Cryptoparty,
just come to the events and your assistance would be much appreciated.
If you have more knowledge about a particular area (e.g.
cryptocurrencies, etc.) and would like to give a 20-30 minute talk
telling us about it, please email jen@redshiftzero.com.
