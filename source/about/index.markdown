The Southside Hackerspace is a collection of nerds, makers, hackers, artists, students, teachers, and other creative people. We meet in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood, where we teach, learn, and make. We are a do-ocracy: if you want something done, do it.

Mission Statement
-----------------

The Hackerspaceâ€™s mission is to establish a community space in which members can collaborate and share knowledge (with each other and the broader community) and to foster an independent network for innovative thinking and creative endeavors.


Finding Us
----------

The space is located at 2233 S. Throop St. Unit 214, Chicago, IL 60608. It's the building with the huge radio tower on it, and the entrance is on the side opposite Throop (closest to the power plant) under the black banners that say Mana Contemporary. There is a buzzer for access on any day but Sunday.

###Driving###

If you're coming from the interstates, exit at Cermak and head west (away from Chinatown) until you reach Racine. The next left (past the power station) will be the parking lot. If coming from the west, take Cermak east and turn right into the parking lot past the Throop light.

###Public Transit###

The 60 bus is a night-owl service route from downtown with a stop at Loomis and Cermak, which is two streets west of the space. The Pink line stops at 18th and Ashland, which is a longer walk. The Red line Cermak/Chinatown stop can connect to the 21 bus westbound during non-owl hours.

###Cycling###

Cermak is cycling-unfriendly, with no bicycle lanes, on-street parking, and angled train tracks across it. It is suggested to ride north a block and then come down Allport and into the parking lot.
