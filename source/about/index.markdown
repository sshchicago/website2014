The Southside Hackerspace is a collection of nerds. We mostly talk on IRC. I hate generating copy. There should be an automated Ruby copy generator. gem install copy. Bam. Done. Anyway, we mostly chat on irc. Sometimes we make things? Maybe you make things too? Anywho, come on down. Smooches. Chris.

Mission Statement
-----------------

We at Southside Hackerspace want to be the very best, like no Chicago hackerspace ever was. To make things is our real quest; community outreach our cause. We will collaborate across the midwest, searching far and wide. To enable something something, the power that's inside.
