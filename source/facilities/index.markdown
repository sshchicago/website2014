The Space
---------

{% img left /images/beginnings.jpg 300 300 %}

We currently rent a 1000 square foot space in the Mana Studios in Pilsen.
It comes with electricity, and has shared bathroom and sink facilities down the hall.
Currently, it is divided into three sections: a woodworking room, a metalworking room, and a common space. 
The common space has tables and chairs for meetings and hacking, lockers for storing projects, an electronics bench, a fridge, and other amenities.  

Currently, the common area is drywalled off from the woodworking and metalworking areas. 
Doors are installed.
We need to finish drywalling, then put up some drywall mud and paint.

We temporarially have a small 4G hotspot serving the needs of our members day-to-day.
