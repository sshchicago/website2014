We are a group of makers and hackers who are putting together a hackerspace on the south side of Chicago (in the Bridgeport/Pilsen area, where most of us live). We are seeking hackers, tinkerers, hobbyists, crafters, artists and doers to help us create a social, educational and collaborative space for ourselves and the community. 
</p>

<p>
We're currently open for hacking! If you're interested, feel free to stop by our regular meetings, Wednesdays at 7:30!
