<p>
We are a group of makers and hackers who are putting together a hackerspace on the south side of Chicago (in the Bridgeport/Pilsen area, where most of us live). We are seeking hackers, tinkerers, hobbyists, crafters, artists and doers to help us create a social, educational and collaborative space for ourselves and the community. 
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, <a href="mailto:ssh@sshchicago.org">email us</a>. If you have no questions, <a href="/join/index.html">join us!</a>
</p>

<p>
We're currently open for hacking! If you're interested, feel free to stop by our regular meetings, Wednesdays at 7:30!
