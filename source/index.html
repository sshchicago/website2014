We are a group of makers and hackers who are putting together a hackerspace on the south side of Chicago (in the Bridgeport/Pilsen area, where most of us live). We are seeking hackers, tinkerers, hobbyists, crafters, artists and doers to help us create a social, educational and collaborative space for ourselves and the community. You can learn more about hackerspaces on hackerspaces.org and Wikipedia.
