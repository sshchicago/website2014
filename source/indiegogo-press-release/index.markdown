Southside Hackerspace aims for $7,000 in under a month!
-------------------------------------------------------

April, 2014
 
*Chicago, IL* - Southside Hackerspace: Chicago (SSH:C) recently launched its first Indiegogo campaign to transform 1,000 square feet into a resource for the undeserved south side. The organization asks for $7,000 in donations to construct a fully functioning workshop, outfitted with woodworking, electronic, metal, laser, and hand tools supported by the appropriate safety equipment.
 
Donors have until May 7th, 2014 to contribute. Contributions will be used to complete construction, purchase additional furniture, technical equipment, and tools such as a flammables cabinet, storage units, task chairs and workbenches, patch cables, server rack shelving, and much more!
 
More details are on the Indiegogo page at [http://igg.me/at/sshchicago](http://igg.me/at/sshchicago)
 
Southside Hackerspace was conceived when founding members living in Bridgeport recognized the opportunity to create a safe learning environment conducive to spreading awareness about STEM+ (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and encouraging individuals to become proactive about DIY projects.
 
Co-Founder, Matt Campbell, elaborates, "Early on we knew we wanted to be involved with the community, and the more we researched, the more we discovered the university students, young professionals, artists, incubators, small businesses, and community projects like us (for example: the Plant and Co-Prosperity Sphere). The growth rate is exponential!"
 
Mason Donahue, current Treasurer and 3D Printer enthusiast, echoed, "[SSH:C] has shown me that there are other people out there who get stuck in a problem, and say, I'm gonna friggin solve this one way or another, and go about learning how to do just that!"

Although only two years old, Southside Hackerspace is ready to push the boundaries of imagination. Brian Kroll, a newly inducted member who has big plans for a Chicago-wide wireless mesh network assures, "You haven't seen anything yet!"
 
39 Funders have contributed already! So don't delay, check out the [indiegogo website](http://igg.me/at/sshchicago) to help us hack on!
 
About Southside Hackerspace: Chicago
What began as five friends in a Bridgeport apartment quickly evolved into a membership-based organization, focused on providing a safe environment for DIY projects and fostering education beyond the classroom.
 
In July 2013, Southside Hackerspace opened its new front doors in a 1,000 sq. ft. unit of Mana Contemporary Art located in Pilsen, a district known for its celebration of creativity, collaboration, and entrepreneurs.
 
About Hackerspaces, Maker Culture, & Do-ocracy
A hackerspace is a place where like-minded individuals challenge one another through collaboration, the sharing of tools and specialized knowledge.
 
Maker Culture stems from DIY mentality. Maker Culture encourages a hands-on approach to engineering and technology related projects, including electronics, robots, 3-D printing, lasercutting, as well as traditional arts, crafts, metalworking and woodworking.
 
Do-ocracy is the practice of asking for forgiveness rather than permission, for enacting change while being respectful to those around you. Do-ocracy and Maker Culture garner investment and pride in the hackerspace as an organization.
 
At Southside Hackerspace, members are dedicated to personal development and philanthropy. The hackerspace movement is a global endeavor that continues to grow daily.
